This text is supposed to demonstrate punctuation:
	This line starts with the tab and ends with a dot.
 * Consider . (dot), ; (semicolon), , (comma), ? (question mark), - (dash), ' (single quote) punctuation characters
 * Don't modify characters within a pair of double quotes.
 * Example:
 *   "- don't use the as-if rule."
 *   Becomes:
 *   "  don t use the as if rule "
Let us what the actual program returned on that line:
- don't use the as-if rule.

(The previous line was an empty line. This line is surrounded in brackets).
"- don't use the as-if rule." - this one has two double quotes 
"- don't use the "as-if rule." - this one has three double quote
" (starts with the double quote)

Extra examples to test as-if rule:
-if (this line starts with hyphen if)
 -if (this line starts with space hypen if)
	-if (this line starts with tab, hyphen if)
this line ends with if hyphen  if-
as space hyphen space if as - if

        // I won't allow it == I will not.
        // I wouldn't allow it == I would not
        // I can't allow it == I can not
        // I don't allow it == I do not

He won't allow it. He would give you the money, but he wouldn't tolerate any disrespect. I can't allow it either. I don't like you.
